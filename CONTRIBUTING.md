# CONTRIBUTING

## Our Mission

We aspire to scale decentralization, cloudless, p2p architectures to new heights, make p2p reliable and contribute
in fostering good, safe, private and trustworthy communities.

### Some Broad stroke guidelines

- Contributions are welcome and encouraged.
- No question is beneath us - we strive to make our discord a "nice" and safe place to be and ask questions.
- We are in this to make the internet a safe, private, decentralized, cloudless, trustworthy by trustless systems place.

This is an evolving project, it isn't stable yet, but we have rules when we commit code:

1. Make sure you fork repo and use sensible branch names.
2. ONLY rebase if possible, merge commits can be complex to understand - otherwise just squash everything.
3. More detailed PRs are preferred - I will be pushing PR template once we have some stable conditions soon.
4. Each milestone can break previous changes - this is part of a non stable work, your code may or may not make it depending on how we decide
to proceed.

### Block-Xaero role

- Block-Xaero is a 2 founder (to-be formalized soon) company. Our objective is to build tools useful for other engineers in building dApps, encourage p2p networks, foster privacy and freedom through simplicity in storage.
- We are in this to commit to future that is equitable for all - we express this notion with out software - keeping it open source, under MPL and free to re-use as per licensing terms.
