# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representation include using an official project e‑mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an event. Representation may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Code of Conduct Committee at <anirudh.vyas@blockxaero.io>. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response deemed necessary and appropriate. The committee is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4, available at <https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html>.

## Interpretation for XAEROFLUX and BLOCK XAERO

To ensure clarity specific to our projects:

- **XAEROFLUX**: All contributors to the xaeroflux codebase, documentation, and community channels are expected to adhere to the above standards. Maintainers should reference this document when evaluating patch submissions, issue interactions, and discussion threads.

- **BLOCK XAERO**: As a startup, all team members, partners, and external contributors must follow these guidelines in our internal communication, public presentations, and customer interactions. Any breach in behavior during product demos, client workshops, or on social media channels representing Block Xaero should be addressed in accordance with the Enforcement section.

Minor deviations should be handled by direct, respectful feedback. Major or repeated violations must be escalated to the Code of Conduct Committee for formal review and action.
